				<h1>WELCOME TO !ART-7 ART GALLERY</h1>
				<h5>We specialise in promoting and selling Russian paintings since 1989 when "perestroika" raised the curtain on the Art Scene in the USSR.</h5>
				<h5>All of our works are acquired directly from the artists or their close relatives and we guar- antee their athenticity.<br>
				We are proud to say that we have organised or taken part in numerous exhibitions in the UK includingtose of internationally known Art Fairs in Olympia (South Kensington).</h5>
				<p>Most of the artists to be found on our site are members of the Russian Union of Artists and as such have been merited with outstanding artistic achievement. Their names can be found in major reference books on Art (Art Price Annual International, Art Sales Index, A Dictionary of 20th Century Russian and Soviet Painters, etc.).</p>

					<img src="./pic/about.png" width="470" height="453" alt="">
					<p>Our Artists category includes land- scapes and still-<br> lifes, portraits and genre scenes.<br> Sizes are various<br> and range from small sketches and studies on board<br> to important large oil canvases which took years<br> to create.</p>
					<p>Artistic approach is highly individual. You will find<br> classical, impressionistic and modern art executed<br> in different media.</p>
				</div>
				<h5>We believe our Socialist Realism Collection is one of the largest in the UK and includes typical ex- amples of this historical Art Trend.</h5>
				<p>As opposed to our Art For Sale content we are currently working on the compilation of a wide database of those very special works, which are not known to everyone, but which we believe will make a powerful impact on the development of contemporary and modern art in the years to come. Though some of these paintings will appear in our Art For Sale section there will be no prices displayed, as these canvases are part of our own permanent collection.</p>
				<p>We are not just a "virtual" gallery. If after browsing, you would like to see our paintings you can always come and see us in London. We run "non-virtual" exhibitions throughout the year and the information about them can be found on our site at any time.</p>
