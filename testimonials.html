				<h1>Testimonials</h1>
				<h5>Who better to attest to the value of the service than those who use it? Below is only a sampling of the dozens of great comments we receive every month.</h5>
				<div>
					<p>"Your service was excellent, and the painting arrived quickly, in perfect condition. The painting itself is very nice. You made trans-Atlantic business as simple as purchasing from the States. Thank you for your follow up. Keep me up to date about your gallery. I now have four paintings from the Russian regions."</p>
					<h3>T. Krehbiel, Cincinnati, USA</h3>

				<div>
					<p>"The $10 I spent was definitely worth it. I was thinking of buying paintings through an online auction, but lack of information has always made me think twice. I have just purchased a painting through an auction with the help of your report, it could have cost me a lot more otherwise! Thank you (and your customer support is second to none!)"</p>
					<h3>Andrew Lucien, San Diego, USA</h3>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>"Just wanted to thank you very much for the parcel which arrived without a hitch. The paintings were a quality above and beyond of what I expected. The delivery service was excellent. I hope I'll have the opportunity to work with you in the future. As a matter of fact, I am thinking of buying one or two more paintings from your company... Thanks again!"</p>
					<h3>Yelena, St. Paul, USA</h3>
